# EMAF: Fast Cryo-EM Image Alignment Algorithm using Power Spectrum Features - BIGDATA Version

## Note
- This is the BIGDATA version of our algorithm. This version changes INT variable to LONG LONG variable which would definitely satisfy requirements for big data size.
- You may find all instructions in the normal version. Therefore, instructions and comments in code are neglected in this version. Refer to [normal version](../README.MD) for more information.
